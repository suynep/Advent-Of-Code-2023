# My solutions for Advent of code 2k23 :))
## About Folders and the nature of Solns:
- Each folder contains two (or more) *.py files, each containing the respective part-wise solution
- Tried to write comments (though sparsely) to aid you, beloved fellow hooman
- `py` files can be run directly through either `chmod 777 *.py` and `./<file>.py` on *nix systems or through VSCode thingy (whoever uses thaat) (NOTE: python3.x interpreter must be installed for the solutions to run)
